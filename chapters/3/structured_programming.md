# Structured Programming

**Lecture Time: 20 Minutes**

* Structured programming (5 minutes)
    * Design that is broken down into code blocks
    * Allows for upgrade of individual blocks
    * Show example of pseudocode, say for example a recipe
        * Upgrade example to show how this could be remade to be reuseable
* Design (15 minutes)
    * Design a block using pseudo code
    * Show control path using flow charts
    * Explain flowchart elements
        * Arrows show control flow
        * Lines show connections
        * Node types:
            * Rectangle = process
            * Diamond = decision
            * Circle = variable or storage
    * Show how above recipe component could be remade into a flowchart component
